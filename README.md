# Python-Scripts

## Overview
This is a collection of Python scripts I've developed to accomplish a certain task, or to learn more about Python development in general.

### Radio Web Scraper
This tool scrapes an online list of radio stations in Alberta, Canada and gathers details on their location, frequency, and broadcast power.

### Resistor Colour Code
This is a simple through-hole resistor colour band decoder. Currently command-line based, I wish to make a GUI in the future.

### Time Calculator
This program takes in clock time formatted strings and adds the times together. The program uses a regular expression to slice the time into hours, minutes and, seconds to be added.
This program also utilizes an external configuration file to store the maximum number of times that can be added and the debug state.
